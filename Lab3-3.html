		<p> My name is Justin and I'm from Texas. Some of my hobbies include baking, old films, and annoying others by making my 448 project slideshows with pictures of Harrison. I can play the trombone like a boss. In fact I play the trombone here in the KU Jazz Ensemble. TEXAS. Did I mention I'm from Texas? Its practically its own country by itself. Also I have a minor in film, therefore my opinion is always right about movies. Also hit me up ladies, because I'm single and ready to mingle ;)  </p>
